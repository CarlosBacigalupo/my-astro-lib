Membership selection criteria

- Distance from core 
- v mag
- metallicity
- proper motion dispersion
- surface gravity
- radial velocity dispersion

Targets selection criteria 
Members
- local density
Sky
Fiducials



Questions:
Where the get V_mag from? Sanjib? (using B_mag at the moment)


Pending:
Calculate field stars contamination
position sky and fiducials fibres
standard stars catalogues?
final selection en RA DEC
tidal radus


TO DO:
sky visual inspection dss
standard stars (look for kens paper or other) any stars well studied within mags 12 13 even field stars (ideally radial velocity)
Look for a list of radial velocities chubak 2012
